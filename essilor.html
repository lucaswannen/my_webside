										<h3>certified project for the Essilor Company</h3>
                    <ul>
                      <li>During one semester</li>
                      <li>Location : Rouen (France)</li>

                    </ul>
					<p>In collaboration with INSA Rouen, I took part, in a team of 8 other students, in a machine learning oriented project for Essilor, leader in ophtalmologic optics.</p>
					<p>The objective of this project was to create a model of face landmarks adapted to specific needs (can't say more due to confidentiality agreements). In particular, we organized a large-scale data collection campaign, and this data was used to create a machine learning model that could be integrated into the client's architecture.</p>

					<p>In this project, we used the scrum-methodology, and we were in close communication with our clients.</p>
