					<p>As part of my 4th year of Engineering School at INSA Rouen, I did an internship at the headquarters of the BGL BNP Paribas bank, located in Luxembourg. The duration of this internship was 4 months. My mission was to start a migration from a data environment doomed to ob-solescence to a target and sustainable platform. I was integrated into the Chief Data Office of the bank.</p>

					<p>This internship allowed me to improve my skills in several aspects, particularly in the field of data engineering. Indeed, the fact of confronting database architectures (DataWareHouse, DataHub) of such magnitude and complexity made me progress in this field. In addition, it allowed me to better understand the banking environment and the regulations in force such as the GDPR</p>
